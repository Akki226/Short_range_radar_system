# Short_range_radar_system
This is a short-range radar system built using an Arduino board, an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and React.js for the front-end interface. The system uses the ultrasonic sensor to scan a 180-degree area and the servo motor to rotate the sensor in that range, and the Arduino board to send the data to the React.js front-end.
# Prerequisites
- Arduino board
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Servo motor,
- Node.js and npm
- React.js
# Installation and Setup
- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Connect the ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and Arduino board
- Upload the Arduino code to the board.
- In the project directory, run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies.
- Run npm start to start the development server and launch the application in the browser.
# Usage
The application will show a radar-like interface with a rotating line that represents the ultrasonic sensor's scan. The distance of the objects in front of the sensor will be displayed on the screen in real-time.
# Troubleshooting
- Make sure that all the connections between the ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and Arduino board are correct.
- Verify that the correct version of Node.js and npm are installed.
- Check that the correct version of the webpack, webpack-cli, and webpack-dev-server are installed and check their compatibility with the package.json.
